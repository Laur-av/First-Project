                        Three things define Romania’s mountainous Sinaia: earthbound tradition, bold architecture, and potential for outdoor sports. Its intrinsic value unravels with every step in its time-worn alleys. In recent years, Sinaia gained attention as a ski resort in winter. In summer, it attracts visitors as a hiking destination. The stimulating climate makes spending time here all the more rewarding. What is more is a refreshing mix of fragrances escalating from the Buceti Mountains. Sinaia may lack the gothic charm of other iconic Romanian landmarks. But, it never fails to fascinate.
                        <span>Aside from Peles and Pelisor Castles, the Sinaia Monastery lures visitors with its rackety charm. The sanctuary was built in 1846 to provide for the town’s religious community. It grew to become a popular landmark. Throughout the years, art, religion, and the rural culture of Romania flourished here. Perfectly blending with the verdant backdrop, the monastery offers a peaceful time. But, Peles and Pelisor alone paint its postcard-like picture. Spend a few hours exploring them, and their marvels will soon unfold.</span></p>

                        Transfagarasan is the best road in the world or at least so said Jeremy Clarkson in a Top Gear episode. Still, it offers so much more besides the amazing driving experience. It’s, first of all, a major creation of the communist regime and its obsession with oversized infrastructure projects.
                        <span>The road is 90 km long and connects the south of Romania with Transylvania. 6,500 tons of dynamite were used to break the Fagaras Mountains, the tallest in Romania. It reaches its highest altitude of 2,042 meters close to Balea Lake. This makes it the second-highest road in the country after Transalpina (2,145 meters) and a great part of any road trip in Romania.</span></p>
